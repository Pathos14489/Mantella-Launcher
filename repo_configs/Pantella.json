Accented xTTS Support, Customizable Multi-Language Support, Custom Prompt Formats/Styles, Advanced Behavior System and NPC Scripting API, Proper Local LLM integration, player name, race and sex awareness, Vision Support via LLaVA, and more!

Also has native transformers support.\n\nSupports: Skyrim SE/AE and Skyrim VR",
